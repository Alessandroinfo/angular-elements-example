🛠️ Web Components with Angular Elements 
==================================

This is a repository that showcases how to create web-components in Angular with [@angular/elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements). 🚀

Angular Elements: What are they? 🤔
-----------------------------------

Angular Elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements (also known as Web Components), a web standard for
defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way. They allow you to encapsulate your logic and styles in reusable
components that can be used across different applications, regardless of the underlying technology stack. 🌍

Project Structure 📂
--------------------

The repository consists of the following files and directories:

```.
├── test-web-components
│   ├── index.html
│   └── tabs-web-components.js
├── app
│   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── tabs-new-way
│   │   ├── tabs-new-way.component.html
│   │   ├── tabs-new-way.component.scss
│   │   └── tabs-new-way.component.ts
│   └── tabs-old-way
│       ├── tabs-old-way.component.html
│       ├── tabs-old-way.component.scss
│       ├── tabs-old-way.component.ts
│       └── tabs-old-way.module.ts
└── main.ts
```

### Project Components

The repository contains two methods to create web components:

- `tabs-old-way`: The older method in which a component was included in a module.
- `tabs-new-way`: The newer method that allows for standalone components.

#### Directory `test-web-components`

- Inside `test-web-components` will be builded the `tabs-web-components.js` that contain the concat of angular builds.
- There you find also index.html that contain the tags of web components:

```html
...
<h1>Tabs old way to implement web-component</h1>
<tabs-old></tabs-old>

<h1>Tabs new way to implement web-component</h1>
<tabs-new></tabs-new>
...
```
<br>

#### `main.ts`

This file contains the bootstrap logic for the Angular application.

In this project, the file also includes a script that defines and registers the `tabs-new` custom element.

#### `app.module.ts`

This file defines the main module of the Angular application.

In this project, the file also includes a script that defines and registers the `tabs-old` custom element.
